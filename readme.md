WAREHOUSE AISLES
=====================

CHANGELOG / OUTLINE

5/20/25
this project is primarily a way for me to learn OOP.

working in  warehouse i am most interested in developing aisle and item classes.

also looking to practice using modules to make code more consistent, and defining functions within classes.

finally, i would like to implement some way to store aisle and item information externally, perhaps in a simple json or database.
